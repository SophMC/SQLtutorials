# SQLtutorials

Here are some Qu. and Ans. to the SQL tutorials I have worked through.

[GalaXQL](http://sol.gfxile.net/g3/) - Interesting subject matter where you get to query a database of stars in a galaxy. 
 - [Ex 2 - 20](GalaXQL/ex1_5.sql).

[SQLZoo](http://sqlzoo.net) - Lots of different datasets to try out. Gives just the right amount of challenge/ help to keep you engaged. 
  - [Intro to Joins (Music)](SQLZoo/Music.sql).
  - [More Joins (Movies)](SQLZoo/Movies.sql)
