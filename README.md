# SQLtutorials

Here I will upload Qu. and Ans. to the SQL tutorials I have worked through.

[GalaXQL](http://sol.gfxile.net/g3/) - Interesting subject matter where you get to query a database of stars in a galaxy. 

[SQLZoo](http://sqlzoo.net) - Lots of different datasets to try out. Gives just the right amount of challenge/ help to keep you engaged.
